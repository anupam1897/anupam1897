## Projects

Here are some of the notable projects I've worked on:

1. **OTP System** - The system generates, sends and resends otp to mobiles directly with custom messages. The system is hosted on heroku cloud. The OTPs exists for only 10 minute after which it expires and gets deleted. 

Technologies Used:
- Back-end: Node.js, Express
- Communication Channels: SMS (Twilio), Email (Nodemailer)
- Database: Redis
- Hosting: Heroku Cloud 

2. **Authentication System** - This project is an authentication system that implements the OAuth protocol for secure and seamless authorization and authentication of users. The system allows users to securely authenticate and authorize third-party applications to access their protected resources, such as social media accounts, without sharing their login credentials. It provides a secure and standardized way to authenticate and authorize users across multiple applications and platforms.

Technologies Used:
- Back-end: Node.js, Express

3. **Ecommerce API for Android Application** - This project is an API developed to serve as the back-end for an E-commerce Android application. It provides a RESTful API that allows the Android app to communicate with the server and perform various e-commerce functionalities, such as product listing, product details, user authentication, shopping cart management, and order processing. Technologies Used:
- Back-end: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB, MySql
